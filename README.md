[Deep Learning-Based U²-Net ID Card Background Remover](url)
This project implements an AI-based ID card background removal system using deep learning (U²-Net) and computer vision techniques. It automatically extracts the ID card from any image while removing complex backgrounds.
[Features](url)

- Uses U²-Net deep learning architecture for accurate foreground-background segmentation.
- Removes the background from ID card images while preserving key details such as photo, text, and barcode.
- Supports image upload and webcam capture through an integrated web interface.
- Deployed via a Flask API, enabling real-time processing.
[Technologies Used](url)

- Python
- PyTorch – model implementation and training
- OpenCV & Pillow – image processing
- Flask – API development
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript – frontend integration
- Label Studio – dataset annotation and mask creation
