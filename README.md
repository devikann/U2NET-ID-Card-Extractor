ðŸ†”ID Card Background Remover using UÂ²-Net
This project implements an AI-based ID card background removal system using deep learning (UÂ²-Net) and computer vision techniques. It automatically extracts the ID card from any image while removing complex backgrounds, making it suitable for eKYC, digital onboarding, and document verification workflows.

âœ¨ Features
Uses UÂ²-Net deep learning architecture for accurate foreground-background segmentation.
Removes the background from ID card images while preserving key details such as photo, text, and barcode.
Supports image upload and webcam capture through an integrated web interface.
Deployed via a Flask API, enabling real-time processing.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
*Python
*PyTorch â€“ model implementation and training
*OpenCV & Pillow â€“ image processing
*Flask â€“ API development
*HTML, CSS, JavaScript â€“ frontend integration
*Label Studio â€“ dataset annotation and mask creation

ðŸš€ Project Workflow
1.Problem Definition: Automate ID card background removal for real-time verification systems.
2.Approach Exploration:
*Edge Detection (Canny)
*Face Detection with Ratio Cropping
*Deep Learning-based Segmentation (UÂ²-Net)
3.Dataset Preparation:
*Used Iranian National ID Card Dataset from Kaggle.
*Annotated images using Label Studio.
*Performed data augmentation to expand the dataset to 1500+ image-mask pairs.
4.Model Training:
*Trained UÂ²-Net for 25 epochs with Binary Cross Entropy loss.
*Achieved high accuracy and generalisation.
5.Evaluation:
F1 Score: ~0.99
IoU: ~0.98
Deployment:
Built a Flask API to serve the trained model.
Developed a web interface for users to upload or capture images and download the extracted ID card.
